# colorapi
This is a WIP mod for unifying colors for Minetest into a beautiful palette that will connect artists with "the land" (dyes nad their sources), instead of just making more and more like unifieddyes does. Part of the aim is to recolor existing nodes to match a beautiful 16-color palette.

## Tasks
- [ ] reorder the palette so the first 8 are compatible with colorfacedir (8-color palette) and the next 8 are lighter or similar light versions of those 8 in order.
